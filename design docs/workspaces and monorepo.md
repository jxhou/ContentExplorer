The idea of monorepo, placing all projects in one single repository, is getting popular with big companies such as google, facebook etc. For small and medium products, the project monorepo (ref 7) can be effective too.

Nx (ref 3) built on the top of angular cli is the first framework to provide workspace support in the form of monorepo. xplat built on top of Nx provides cross platform support.

Starting from angular 6.0, Angular cli supports workspace natively (ref 1, 2).
